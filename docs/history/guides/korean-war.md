## Why the Line along the 38th parallel of Korea?

The US detonated a devastating nuclear weapon over the Japanese city of Hiroshima and followed it with another one over Nagasaki three days later. With the Japanese surrender imminent, it meant the Soviets were not needed anymore, but Stalin's army nevertheless made its way through Manchuria and Korea with relative ease. 

This advancement was crucial since it allowed the Soviets to gain a share of the spoils as agreed with U.S. The Americans, however, were worried that the Soviet army would continue south and eventually take the whole peninsula. In an attempt to prevent Stalin from doing so, Washington hastily proposed drawing a line along the 38th parallel of Korea, dividing the country in two.
