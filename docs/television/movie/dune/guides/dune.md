# Dune

## Starting point

Herbert was born in 1920, and the Dune saga began with serials published in sci-fi magazines, in around 1963.

## Arrakis

Arrakis – the planet in Dune – is an ecology.

## Paul Atreides

Paul Atreides, the hero of Dune, discovers that he has been gifted with incredible, superhuman powers – such as precognition and omniscience.

## Dune

Dune is the informal name for the planet Arrakis, a rugged desert world located in the star system Canopus and where much of the story unfolds.

## Inhabitants of Dune

Its two main inhabitants are a tough group of people called the Fremen, and the native ShaiHulud – a species of giant sandworm that lives for thousands of years and can grow to more than two kilometres in length.

## Diet of a sandworm

The major diet of the Shai-Hulud is sand, supplemented with tiny organisms known as sand plankton. As they digest this rather bland fare, their metabolism releases oxygen – which perhaps isn’t so far-fetched given that sand is just silicon dioxide (an atom of silicon bonded to two atoms of oxygen). And this gives Arrakis an atmosphere that’s breathable to humans. On Earth, we owe our breathable atmosphere to photosynthesis by plants and bacteria. These take in carbon dioxide and water, combine them with sunlight to create food for themselves in the form of sugars, and give out oxygen along the way.

## Spice

Spice melange, usually just referred to as ‘the spice’, is a valuable narcotic substance, formed exclusively in the sands of the planet Arrakis from the excretions of young sandworms.

The spice confers health benefits, for example increasing life expectancy. It’s also highly addictive, creating a vast demand and making it an extremely precious commodity. Whoever controls the spice inevitably holds control over every other faction in the Dune universe.

## Blue eyes

Even moderate exposure to the spice stains the entire eye of the user a deep dark blue, a trait seen in the Fremen people of Arrakis, due to their constant exposure to the substance.

## ornithopter

The ornithopter craft were built by British company BGI.
