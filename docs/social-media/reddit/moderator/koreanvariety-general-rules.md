# Korean Variety general rules

1. Spam

Spamming is not allowed.

2. Hurtful or inappropriate comments.

Please use a civil tone in discussion, and do not leave hurtful, or otherwise inappropriate comments.

3. Repost

Don't make a new post if there is already a thread on the same topic, or there has been a topic on the same subject very recently.

4. Song or episode identification post.

Don't make a new post to identify songs, nor to identify specific episodes. Put it in the relevant episode discussion, the [Midweek Talk or Weekend Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/search?q=Midweek+Talk+OR+Weekend+Talk&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) post, or try [r/NameThatSong](/r/NameThatSong) or [r/kpophelp](/r/kpophelp)

5. Streaming & download request as a new post.

Where to watch episodes or shows is covered by the 'Shows of the Week' post. Put questions in there. If you're looking for where to watch an older show/episode, put your question in the [Midweek Talk or Weekend Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/search?q=Midweek+Talk+OR+Weekend+Talk&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) post.

6. Not Korean Variety related

Any content submission should in some way be related to Korean variety. For off-topic questions, use the [Midweek or Weekend talk threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/search?q=Midweek+Talk+OR+Weekend+Talk&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)

7. Incorrect submission format

For episode posts, please include the full name of the show in the title, alongside episode number and the date the show aired in Korea, preferrably in a YYMMDD format. More info and post [templates here](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/post_templates).
