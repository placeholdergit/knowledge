# Korean Variety Mod Rules

## Message from the main moderator

Think this'll work out great!
adding you and ScrewySiu as moderators. Screwy is in the american timezones
I made a little wiki pages with some pointers about moderating and some copypastas to copy
https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/mod_copypasta
If there are any questions, feel free to ask.
Among the older mods I'm the pretty much the only active one. hubwub also steps in now and then. He also approves everything (automated), so if he's approved something you feel is a rule break, then just override it.
but yeah the copypasta wiki link above should cover most of it.
The invite to mod should come as a DM, if I remember correctly.
Entirely up to you whether you want to make a post about joining as a moderator, once you've accepted.

## Mod copypasta

*   *   [Unlicensed Websites](#wiki_unlicensed_websites)

Here are some tips and tricks for dealing with stuff.

# Rules - Copypasta

The two rules are broken most often is Rules 5 & 6\. You can copy the text below as a standard response. This saves a lot of time. They're also written in an overly nice way to de-escalate any frustration from the users who have their posts removed.

### Rule 5

For episode and/or song identification. These go in the Weekly Talk threads instead. Because they are somewhat frequent, and often yields only one response (the answer), and then there's nothing more to talk about. **People who are looking for recommendations, or a certain type of episode (plural) can stay up, because that can yield more discussion than a few responses.

    **Rule 5**: Don't make a new thread to identify or find songs, nor to identify specific episodes/shows. Put it in the relevant episode discussion, the [Weekly Talk thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/search?q=Midweek+Talk+OR+Weekend+Talk&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=koreanvariety&utm_content=t5_2wv54), or in the case of songs, try [KVarietyBGMs](http://kvarietybgms.blogspot.com/), r/NameThatSong or r/kpophelp

    Sorry for the inconvenience, this is not to make things difficult. These questions seldom yield much discussion other than an answer, and there's always someone looking to identify either songs, shows or episodes. There was a lot of these threads when they were allowed, and rather than have a barrage of threads, they have been restricted to the options listed above. Feel free to post your question in either of those options though. :)

### Rule 6

This is the most frequent violation. They are spammy, and we have two regular threads that cover this topic. When they were allowed, there'd be a lot of them. Including on one occasion for different threads looking for different episodes of I Live Alone within a few hours of each other.

    **Rule 6**: Where to watch episodes or shows is covered by the 'Shows of the Week' post. Click the title to see the full list. If you're looking for where to watch an older show/episode, put your question in the [Weekly Talk Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/search?q=Midweek+Talk+OR+Weekend+Talk&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) post. This also covers questions about subtitles.

    Really sorry for the inconvenience, but the rule is in place because there is always someone looking for videos, streams, subtitles or similar. Rather than having a barrage of threads they have been restricted to the options listed above. The Shows of the Week thread is stickied every week, dedicated to all subbed shows. There is also the Weekly Talk thread. Luckily, lots of people swing by there as well

# Rules of Engagemnt

## Be Friendly

Always be friendly, and try to de-escalate any situation. Some few people will get angry, and they can get mean. Don't engage back. If you get angry, take a breather before replying. Try to explain the reason you have removed their post, and leave emotions out of it.

Be helpful when you can, and remember that not everyone has the same level of knowledge on our subreddit as you do.

## Banning Users

Try to avoid doing this. Everybody can get heated once and again, or step out of bounds. In most cases people are just not aware of the rules. Every subreddit has rules, people will break them even without it being on purpose.

Even on repeated violations, it'd be good to use the filter list in the automod config rather than banning users. That way their posts get filtered, so we can look at them and approve the ones that are okay to make. Encouraging better behaviour rather than just outing people.

Whenever someone is added to the filter list, try to go back and check on them now and again, so they can be removed from the filter list once they behave according to the rules.

If you're having trouble dealing with a situation, just tag me in the comment reply, or send me a DM.

## Arguments / Insults

People can comment on variety personalities freely, as long as it's not hatespeech, repeated comments over a long time, or seem to be done with the express purpose of winding up other redditors.

There's never a need to start discussing ad hominem, meaning you attack or comment on the other redditor, rather than addressing the discussion/argument. If someone goes 'you're so dumb, this is completely wrong.' i.e.

I let minor comments slide if it's a small part long comment that's otherwise constructive, but feel free to step in if the overall argument is no longer constructive.

When you remove something, you can reply to one comment and tag both users by typing /u/ and then their username. They'll both be notified. (i.e. [/u/username](/u/username)

# Other Stuff

## Stuff to Remove

*   People mentioning unlicensed websites
*   People being mean to other redditors
*   Spam / ads
*   Stuff that's clearly not related to Korean Variety (indirectly related like a variety star giving to charity i.e. is fine)
*   People that make a thread to post their opinion on an episode there's already a thread for
*   Topics recently covered
*   Repeat topic (if there's not been a thread for 2 weeks+ then it's fine)

## Episode Posts

These are actually linked in the text when you go to create a thread. Not everyone sees them. There's a pre-made template people can [copy from freely here](https://www.reddit.com/r/koreanvariety/wiki/post_templates).

For episode posts, the most important thing to check is that the source is linked. VIU, Kocowa, and the link that actually subtitle the show, or the person or group that subbed the episode. I've let people get away with just typing the name of the subber, but ideally it should be linked.

**Unlicensed websites do not need to be linked or mentioned.** Please remove instances where that happens (unless it's in the weekly talk thread). Directing traffic towards the official sources helps traffic. Traffic means shows stay subbed. People will find unlicensed sources if they want to go down that route, we do not need promote that.

Torrents and that redditor-created GoPlay website (no ads, or mining) are allowed as alternatives for those that can't watch legally. They're not required, but allowed.

People can also start a discussion thread for episodes without linking anything. That's totally fine. Always encourage discussion threads.

## Sourcing News

Sourcing also goes for news. The source should be linked, whether that's an instagram post or a soompi article.

## Filtered Links

Some links, like MEGA get removed by Reddit. Some can be approved by moderators and brought back, automoderator is set to that for a lot of links. Whilst other links are hard-banned by reddit, and if someone links such a page, the post cannot be brought back. Usually not even after the link has been removed.

## Go Soft On

People that put in a lot of effort. If they make a long thread, i.e. an episode thread, and there's no source linked, or there's something else wrong with it, DM-ing them will suffice. There's no need to remove the entire thread. Esp. for episode threads. We want plenty of those.

## Unlicensed Websites

**Unlicensed websites do not need to be linked or mentioned.** Please remove instances where that happens (unless it's in the weekly talk thread). Directing traffic towards the official sources helps traffic. Traffic means shows stay subbed. People will find unlicensed sources if they want to go down that route, we do not need promote that.

Torrents and that redditor-created GoPlay website (no ads, or mining) are allowed as alternatives for those that can't watch legally. They're not required, but allowed.

Direct mentions of these sites should be snapped up by the automoderator, but not always.
