# Moderator

## Basic

A moderator, or a mod for short, are redditors who volunteer their time to help guide and create Reddit's many communities. Each Reddit community has its own focus, look, and rules, including what posts are on-topic there and how users are expected to behave. 

Some of the things mods can do within their community are: 

*   Distinguish their posts or comments as official moderator submissions. 
*   Remove posts and comments from their community.
*   Ban spammers or other redditors who may be breaking community rules from posting or commenting in their community. 
*   Add other redditors as moderators.

## Healthy community

## Answer questions

Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.

### Appeals

Healthy communities allow for appropriate discussion (and appeal) of moderator actions. Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.
