Technical Essentials Handbook

## Naming

- bookmarks - for interesting blogs, links that may not be a MUST read to get started.

- resources - links to MUST read resources.

- guides - guides for a topic. Does not necessarily need to be comprehensive or complete. The pages in the guides may be expanded eventually. In the page of a guide, make sure to point to references for further reading.

- quickstart - contains getting started guides to a topic. `getting-started` is for the main topic. If there are subtopics, name it `getting-started-topicname`

- tech-support - error or workaround, configuration, etc.

- misc - random info regarding a topic, may or may not be useful.

- concepts - concepts surrounding a topic.

- tools-and-tips - MAY BE renamed or deprecated. It contains short tips or info for which a seperate page (like in guides) is not warranted. It's meant for small, quick info.
